        largeDesc: "Two-wheel drive robot controlled by an ATMega324PA microcontroller, programmed in C and C++ with a custom Makefile. Project conducted in a team of six during Fall 2024. The project involved building and programming a robot capable of solving two challenges: finding the shortest path to a chosen point (using Dijkstra's algorithm) and navigating obstacles on a table with specific dimensions and markings. \n\nKey tasks included:\n\n- **Identification of Starting Point**: The robot determined its initial position using interrupt-based logic, displaying its coordinates and orientation on an LCD.\n\n- **Pathfinding**: Using Dijkstra's algorithm, the robot calculated the shortest path to a selected destination while dynamically avoiding obstacles.\n\n- **Obstacle Detection**: The robot detected obstacles, recalculated its route, and continued its journey to the destination.\n\n- **Real-time Updates**: The robot displayed real-time coordinates and provided feedback throughout its operation.\n\n- **Hardware Components**: The project utilized:\n  - Line follower sensor (Maker Line by Cytron)\n  - Distance sensor (GP2D120 by Sharp)\n  - LCD display\n  - Breadboard setup\n  - Two motorized wheels\n  - ATMega324PA and ATMega8 microcontrollers\n  - 9V battery and rechargeable AA batteries\n\nThe robot operated on a 4x8-foot table with 28 points connected by edges of varying weights. Red edges had a weight of 5, yellow edges 2, and black edges 1. The robot ensured cost-efficient pathfinding, avoiding higher-weighted edges when possible.\n\nAdditional project details, including the full equipment list, implementation steps, and related documentation, are available on the course website: [INF1900 Project Official Site](https://cours.polymtl.ca/inf1900/tp/projet/epreuves/).",

        heading: "CANSLIM Calculator",
        smallDesc: "Web application for advanced stock analysis using CAN SLIM strategy",
        largeDesc: "Created a comprehensive web application to evaluate stock investments based on the CAN SLIM strategy, focusing on implementing a custom algorithm to calculate the CAN SLIM index. This algorithm processes multiple financial metrics, including EPS growth, ROE, sales trends, and institutional ownership, derived from real-time data fetched via the unofficial Yahoo Finance API. \n\nThe application is structured into intuitive sections such as Trending Stocks, Market News, and a Stock-Buying Checklist, guiding users through the CAN SLIM methodology. The algorithm assigns ratings to stocks, breaking down their performance across key categories like earnings, technical analysis, and institutional activity, while also calculating overall composite scores.\n\nThe front-end is built with native HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a lightweight and responsive design. It is deployed on Vercel for high performance. The back-end, implemented in Express.js and hosted on Heroku, manages API requests, handles data processing, and delivers results seamlessly. Additionally, the site features SEO optimization, integrated Google Analytics 4 tracking, and a user-friendly interface.\n\nRegular updates are published via ùïè (@simy46_), ensuring transparency and continuous improvement. This project not only demonstrates advanced algorithm design and data processing capabilities but also provides a practical tool for investors seeking to analyze stocks effectively.",

The game features real-time multiplayer functionality and dynamic interactions powered by websockets. The project was designed to create a Viking-themed experience, incorporating features like live player updates, map-based exploration, and combat mechanics. The game leverages advanced TypeScript and modular design principles for scalability and maintainability.",
